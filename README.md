AI Learning Journey
My path from zero AI/ML knowledge to a working understanding of modern AI Technologies

## Goals
- Master AI/ML fundamentals in 6 months
- Build learning assistant AI agent (capstone project)
- Develop deep understanding, not just library usage

## Background
- BS in Computer Science (Systems Engineering)
- Comfortable with Python, Java, C#, C
- Strong systems background (OS, distributed systems)
- Excited to combine systems + AI!

## Progress

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-6)
- [x] Day 1: Environment setup, vector basics
- [ ] Day 2: Linear combinations and transformations
- [ ] ...

## Structure
- `phase1/`: Classical ML and math foundations
- `phase2/`: Deep learning and NLP
- `phase3/`: Transformers and AI agents
- `phase4/`: Capstone project
- `JOURNAL.md`: Daily reflections
